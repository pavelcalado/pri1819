\section{}

The Whoosh search engine provides three different ranking functions: \emph{BM25}, \emph{TF_IDF} (i.e. cosine similarity) and \emph{Frequency}\footnote{\url{https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/scoring.html}}. 

The following example code shows how to perform a query using Whoosh with the
TF_IDF scoring function and obtain the textual similarity score:
\begin{verbatim}
from whoosh.index import open_dir
from whoosh.qparser import *
ix = open_dir("indexdir")
with ix.searcher(weighting=scoring.TF_IDF()) as searcher:
    query = QueryParser("content", ix.schema, group=OrGroup).parse(u"first document")
    results = searcher.search(query, limit=100)
    for i,r in enumerate(results):
        print r, results.score(i)
\end{verbatim}

The goal of this exercise is to create a method for scoring the documents that combines the results from these three functions.
